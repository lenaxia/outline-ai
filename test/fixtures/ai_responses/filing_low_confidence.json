It contains technical API endpoint specifications, authentication flows, and code examples (suggesting Engineering), but it's framed from a mobile app perspective with user-facing features, SDK examples for iOS/Android, and focus on mobile user experience (suggesting Product). The document serves both as API implementation reference for backend engineers and as integration guide for mobile product development. Without additional context about the primary audience or intent, classification confidence is low.",
